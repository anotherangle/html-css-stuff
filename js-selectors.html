        <div id="desc">There are typically three ways to add JavaScript to a web page:
          Embedding the JavaScript code between a pair of script tag.<br>
         <br>Creating an external JavaScript file with the .js extension and then load it within the page through the src attribute of the script tag.
        <br>Placing the JavaScript code directly inside an HTML tag using the special tag attributes such as onclick, onmouseover, onkeypress, onload, etc
